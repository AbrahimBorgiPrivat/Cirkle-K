# Project Structure Overview

This repository is organized into four main directories, each serving a specific purpose in the project workflow:

---

### `/code/`
Contains all relevant python scripts, modules, or automation logic used in the project.  
See the dedicated [`code/README.md`](./code/README.md) for details.

---

### `/documentation/`
Holds manuals, design notes, project descriptions, and other written documents that support understanding or onboarding.

---

### `/files/`
Used to store raw data files and resources consumed by the project.
See the dedicated [`files/README.md`](./files/README.md) for details.

---

### `/rapports/`
This folder includes generated reports and semanticmodels and the visual elements (png,img) used in the reporting.  
More info available in [`rapports/README.md`](./rapports/README.md).

Each folder is structured to keep development, data, and reporting cleanly separated for better maintainability and clarity.
