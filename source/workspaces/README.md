# Circle K Simulated Case ‚Äî Power BI Project

This workspace contains the Power BI solution for the **Circle K Loyalty Simulation Project**, designed to explore customer behavior, segmentation, and campaign engagement through interactive dashboards and data modeling.

The project is structured using Power BI‚Äôs `.pbip` format and includes a custom theme, report pages, and semantic model.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `pbip/`
This is the core of the Power BI project, structured according to the PBIP folder convention.

- **Circle K Simulated Case.pbip**  
  Combined entry file for the Power BI project  
  - `.Report`: Visual layout and report page definitions  
  - `.SemanticModel`: Semantic model structure with relationships, measures, and metadata  
  - `.pbip`: PBIP file linking components together  

> Note: This solution runs on simulated data generated for case demonstration purposes. No real customer data is used.

### `Images/`
Contains visual assets used in the report pages, such as custom background images and layout elements.

---

### `CirkleKPBITheme.json`
Custom Power BI theme file, designed to align the report visuals with Circle K‚Äôs visual identity ‚Äî using branded color palettes, font styles, and layout consistency.
